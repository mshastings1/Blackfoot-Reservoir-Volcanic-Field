## Datafile descriptions

All the data collected by the University of South Florida has been reduced to a base station in the town of Soda Springs, ID. The corrections made to the data include the latitude (theoretical), atmospheric, free-air, spherical cap Bouguer, and terrain correction. The tidal and drift corrections are tied into the observed gravity measurement in the datafiles. The marine data has additional corrections (Eotvos and platform response) that are tied up in the observed gravity measurement within the datafile. These corrections are made to compensate for the motion of the gravimeter in relation to the rotational axis of the Earth as well as the motion of the platform in response to tilting from wave action. 

The USGS data was reprocessed using the same corrections for the data that USF collected, and tie in points were used to shift the anomaly values to be consitent with the USF data.
